# ✔️MYSecure : Microsoft Engage Project'22( With Face Recognition Technology)

### MY-SECURE is the Web Application that helps you manage your passwords as we generally have many passwords for different websites. So, It becomes difficult for us to remember them all, and storing it anywhere is not secure at all. So, Here's MY-SECURE to help you to save and manage your passwords.

&nbsp;

#### ✂️ Note : As I was getting issue while merging the code of password manager and face recognition system as firstly I have made them seprately so I have hosted the password manager and then the link embeded in the face  recognition application. So, the code of passwd Manager is in another repository. You can access it through the link below 👇.

## Challenges Faced and Learnings
- I don't know Flask and never built any application on it, So firstly I learned Flask through LinkedIn Learning completed the Flask essential training, made the URL shortener small application to understand it more, and then started to build MY-SECURE.
- I have faced problems in using Face Recognition Library but read the documentation and was successfully able to implement it.
- I have faced a lot of issues and errors while making a login system using Flask but reading the documentation of Flask-login and some YouTube videos helped alot.
- After I had made two separate models face recognition and password manager thinking that I would be able to merge it but faced the issue and many errors due to a version related issue, This has taken a lot of time and even up to 3-4 days. after that, I got the idea to host the password manager and embed the link in my first application.
- I have learned a lot during the Engage program and fell in love with development and problem-solving. It's overall a great experience.

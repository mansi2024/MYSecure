#### ✂️ Note : As I was getting issue while merging the code of password manager and face recognition system as firstly I have made them seprately so I have hosted the password manager and then the link embeded in the face  recognition application. So, the code of passwd Manager is in another repository. You can access it through the link below 👇.
